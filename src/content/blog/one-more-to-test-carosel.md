<p>Young salmon in central Sweden must endure a gauntlet to migrate from their freshwater spawning grounds to the Baltic Sea. Their 28-km route along the Dal River is rife with danger, from northern pike and seabirds to hydropower dams.</p><ol><li>Four out of five fish don’t make it.</li><li>Some Atlantic salmon recently got an unexpected edge, after scientists dosed them with antianxiety drugs meant for humans, not fish. The drug, clobazam, made the fish more independent and faster, research published last week found - but scientists said the seemingly positive effects could belie hidden or long-term consequences for the fish. And the mere existence of the study speaks to a growing problem: We’re turning our rivers, lakes and oceans into soups of pharmaceutical pollution.</li></ol>
