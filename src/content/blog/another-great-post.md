<p>Digisha Patel and Chirag Shah, their two young children, and two other family members were living at 5 Nephrite Lane until the blaze erupted around 8.30pm.</p><p>Shah said he was in Hamilton for work at the time of the fire, while his wife and children were at a friend’s home for dinner with his father, who was visiting from India.</p><p>“The fire started in my cousin’s room. He was eating dinner and came downstairs to do the dishes when the smoke alarm went off. He ran upstairs and saw the mattress had caught fire, possibly from the left side,” he said.</p><p>“He tried to put water on it, but the foam caught quickly and the fire spread rapidly. The whole building went up in flames.”</p><p>“We still don’t know exactly how it started. It could’ve been an electrical issue, maybe something plugged in. Everything’s gone, so it’s hard to say for sure.”</p><p>“It was so heavy a fire,” Shah told&nbsp;<em>the Herald.</em></p>
